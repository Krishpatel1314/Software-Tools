        <p id="pfirst">Peer pressure can be both negative and positive. Because if a person is a peer 
            pressuring you for a good cause then it is motivation. Motivation is essential for the growth 
            of a person. While peer pressure for a bad cause will always lead you to a <span>situation</span>.</p>
        <h1>Advantages of Peer pressure</h1>
        <p id="psecond">Peer pressure is advantageous in many ways. Most importantly it creates a sense of <span>motivation</span>
             in the person. Which further forces the person to cross the barrier and achieve something great. Furthermore, 
             it boosts the confidence of a person. Because our brain considers people's opinions and makes them a priority.</p>
